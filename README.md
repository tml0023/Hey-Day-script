# Hey-Day-script
   This script was written in spirit of the Auburn University 2020 Hey Day!
   
### What is Hey Day?
Hey Day is an Auburn tradition dating back to World War II. It was started as a day to encourage the university and the community to become more united. Each year we celebrate this day and focus on the great friends, mentors, and colleagues at Auburn University. On campus there will be name tags distributed to allow fellow Tigers to celebrate Hey Day properly with their peers. Please on **Wednesday, October 14th** join your fellow Auburn Tigers in celebrating Hey Day!
